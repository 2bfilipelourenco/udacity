Final Project - Rock, Scissor n' Paper

## Introduction
This is my final project 'Rock, Scissor n' Paper' from Udacity course 'Introduction to Programming'.

I used to help me to do this project, some sites like: 

- Python (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/);

- W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp);

- Curso em VÃ­deo (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWvhVmt0Qac3HgsjQK62FQ);

## Explantion
I used six (6) class in my program: 

- Player ~ It is the class that will be inherited by the other class: Aleatorio, Humano, Copiador and Ciclo; 

- RandomPlayer ~ The (class) player that will be command by a computer and will play random; 

- HumanPlayer ~ The (class) player that will be command by a humam; 

- ReflectPlayer ~ The (class) player that will be command by a computer and will play a copy game; 

- CyclerPlayer ~ The (class) player that will be command by a computer and will player a cycle game. Always in this sequence: Rock, scissor and them paper; 

- Game ~ The class that will define/control the winner (def vencedor), the scoreboard (def placar), the final score (def placar_final), the round (def play_round) and the match (def play_match) of the game.
