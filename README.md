This is my final project 'Rock, Scissor n' Paper' from Udacity course 'Introduction to Programming'.

I used six (6) class in my program: 

- Player ~ It is the class that will be inherited by the other class: Aleatorio, Humano, Copiador and Ciclo; 

- Aleatorio ~ The (class) player that will be command by a computer and will play random; 

- Humano ~ The (class) player that will be command by a humam; 

- Copiador ~ The (class) player that will be command by a computer and will play a copy game; 

- Ciclo ~ The (class) player that will be command by a computer and will player a cycle game. Always in this sequence: Rock, scissor and them paper; 

- Game ~ The class that will define/control the winner (def vencedor), the scoreboard (def placar), the final score (def placar_final), the round (def play_round) and the match (def play_match) of the game.
